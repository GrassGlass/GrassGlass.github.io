Hello there. I just graduated (28/11/2024) from Junior College. I'm interested in math and have self-studied a little: introductory set theory, linear algebra, and real analysis. I hoped that I could finish Friedberg and baby Rudin (up to sequences of functions) by the end of the year, but that seems unlikely. 

It would be nice to self-study more topics — multivariable analysis, measure theory, and algebra up to at least groups, rings, and fields — before university starts. I might hence be able to take on 'more advanced' classes from the get-go, which would bring me closer to my goal: to learn about as many subfields of math as I can, each with nontrivial depth (for an undergradate student). From AT, AG, DT, DG, FA, CA, SCV to set theory, model theory, and so much more, I wish to learn more about them (eventually). 

I never really had a natural talent for math and progress is always slow for me. Instead, I just have had a slight amount of persistence and acceptence that math takes time to learn. That's also why I like self-studying: there is no time pressure. When university comes, I hope that I will be able to continue enjoying math and play around with it.
